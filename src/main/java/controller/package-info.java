package controller;

/*
        Controller typically are the beans, which are paired to the xhtml files. To speak in application layers
        our controller beans lay straight beneath our views.
        We remind: view → controller → service → repository → database.
        In this simple example we have no need for a additional service layer,
        because we do no processing on our data. Therefor I only need classic crud (create, read, update, delete)
        operations, which are usually provided by the so called repository layer.
